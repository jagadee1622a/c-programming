question-1

1. Imagine you're at a provision store, and you need to buy different products like rice, sugar, and oil. Each product has a price and quantity, and the store applies a 5% tax on the total purchase.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
float quantity_of_rice,cost_of_rice,quantity_of_oil,cost_of_oil,quantity_of_sugar,cost_of_sugar,total_amount_without_tax,tax_amount,total_amount_with_tax;
 printf("quantity of rice in kgs=");
 scanf("%f",&quantity_of_rice);
 printf("cost of rice=");
 scanf("%f",&cost_of_rice);
 printf("quanity of oil in liters=");
 scanf("%f",&quantity_of_oil);
 printf("cost of oil=");
 scanf("%f",&cost_of_oil);
 printf("quantity of sugar kgs=");
 scanf("%f",&quantity_of_sugar);
 printf("cost of sugar kgs=");
 scanf("%f",&cost_of_sugar);
 total_amount_without_tax= quantity_of_rice*cost_of_rice+quantity_of_sugar*cost_of_sugar+quantity_of_oil*cost_of_oil;
printf("total amount without tax=%.2f\n",total_amount_without_tax);
tax_amount=total_amount_without_tax*5/100;
printf("tax amount=%.2f\n",tax_amount);
total_amount_with_tax=total_amount_without_tax+tax_amount;
printf("total amount with tax=%.2f\n",total_amount_with_tax);
return 0;
}
 
 output=
quantity of rice in kgs=1
cost of rice=100
quanity of oil in liters=2
cost of oil=140
quantity of sugar kgs=1
cost of sugar kgs=40
total amount without tax=420.00
tax amount=21.00
total amount with tax=441.00

question-2

2. You are at an electronics store purchasing different gadgets like a laptop, headphones, and a phone charger. Each item has a price and quantity, and there is a 10% tax added to the total amount at checkout.

Questions:

How many laptops do you wish to buy? What is the price of one laptop?
How many pairs of headphones are you purchasing? What is the price for each pair?
How many phone chargers are you buying? What is the price of each charger?
What is your subtotal before tax?
How much tax is added to the subtotal?
What is the total amount to pay, including tax?


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,sum;
float h;
printf("how many laptops do you wish to buy=");
scanf("%d",&a);
printf("what is the price of the one laptop=");
scanf("%d",&b);
printf("how many pairs of head phones are you purchasing=");
scanf("%d",&c);
printf("what is the price of each pair for each pair=");
scanf("%d",&d);
printf("how many phone chargers are you buying=");
scanf("%d",&e);
printf("what is the price of each charger=");
scanf("%d",&f);
g=a*b+c*d+e*f;
printf("what is your subtotal before tax=%d\n",g);
h=g*10/100;
printf("how much tax is  added to the subtotal=%f\n",h);
sum=g+h;
printf("total amount to be paid including tax=%d\n",sum);
return 0;
}

output=

how many laptops do you wish to buy=2
what is the price of the one laptop=65000
how many pairs of head phones are you purchasing=1
what is the price of each pair for each pair=1200
how many phone chargers are you buying=1
what is the price of each charger=3000
what is your subtotal before tax=134200
how much tax is  added to the subtotal=13420.000000
